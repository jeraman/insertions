# Tutorial
This system is OS X-only and was tested in a OS X 10.11.6. Let me know if you ever test this in another version/distribution, I'd love to know!

## Dependencies
To start, we need to install the following software:
- [webInsertion software](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/iiwf8gqqzjp75fn/AAB8OtNXv44U7p0Vcwti85aOa?dl=0): Software that allows you to modify the incoming video using a friendly programming languages, as if it was a webcam. Make sure you download the right version for you platform (i.e. 32 or 64 bits). In addition, because this software is not Apple certified, thereâ€™s a chance you might have a security-related problem (*"this application is damaged and cannot be opened"* or something like that). In this case, follow [this link](http://osxdaily.com/2016/09/27/allow-apps-from-anywhere-macos-gatekeeper/) to solve the problem;
- [Youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/): Command line tool that allows you to extract an m3u8 file from several resources, such as Youtube Live and others;
- [Open-broadcast software](https://obsproject.com/): Software tool that allows you to broadcast videos to several services such as Youtube and Facebook Live;

### For developers
If you are familiar with C++/Openframeworks, and want to modify the source-code by yourself, you're also going to need:
- openFrameworks (version 0.9.8, available [here](http://openframeworks.cc/download/));
- xCode (get started on using xCode with openFrameworks [here](http://openframeworks.cc/setup/xcode/));
...and the following oF addons:
- https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxAvFoundationHLSPlayer
- https://github.com/astellato/ofxSyphon

If you're not a developer, nevermind. Just skip this step and go directly to the following subsection.

## Process
The image below summarizes the process. After selecting your video target (picture (a)), you will process it locally on Pd (picture (b)), and then stream it back to youtube (picture (c)).

## Step 1
In the beginning, you need to choose the Youtube live stream video you want to target. This video is represented in the picture above by (a).
You only need to copy the URL and paste it in a text file called "video.txt", inside the folder "data" that comes along with the webInsertion software you downloaded.
