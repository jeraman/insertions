# Capture and backstream
Here, I cover research on:
1. **Efficient capturing**: How to efficiently capture a TV video and manipulate it via code?
2. **Efficient backstream**: How to efficiently stream the manipulated video back to the internet/Raspberry PI?

## Efficient capturing
We need to be able to capture [m3u](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U) files used by [HLS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-20) and import it as a regular video into code. M3u is used both by youtube live and by Suntek's streamserver.

A m3u file for testing:

http://devimages.apple.com/iphone/samples/bipbop/bipbopall.m3u8

It seems that AvFoundation is able to play m3u8 files. Digging into this direction now.

Tried this using oF's native ofVideoPlayer with no success. Posted a question here:

https://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/hls-m3u8-http-live-streaming-video/11927

This seems to be an old and recurrent unsolved problem. See for example these threads:
- https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1741
- https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/4662
- https://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/ofvideoplayer-load-and-loadmovie-problems-when-streaming/21636/8

There are two paths to test. Using *ofxGStreamer* and using *ofxAvFoundationHLSPlayer*

### ofxAvFoundationHLSPlayer
This is the solution I've found!
https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxAvFoundationHLSPlayer

It is possible to get a higher quality link from youtube-dl by using -f parameter. For example:
```
youtube-dl -f 95 -g https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Te20A6b1Ac
```

To test the quality before feeding it to oF, you can use:
```
ffplay https://manifest.googlevideo.com/api/manifest/hls_playlist/id/6Te20A6b1Ac.1/itag/95/source/yt_live_broadcast/requiressl/yes/ratebypass/yes/live/1/cmbypass/yes/goi/160/sgoap/gir%3Dyes%3Bitag%3D140/sgovp/gir%3Dyes%3Bitag%3D136/hls_chunk_host/r1---sn-cxaaj5o5q5-t0as.googlevideo.com/ei/FQDoWIHjF5T_7gSIi46ICA/gcr/ca/playlist_type/LIVE/mm/32/mn/sn-cxaaj5o5q5-t0as/ms/lv/mv/m/pl/22/dover/6/upn/pyw5RWEuy1s/mt/1491599289/ip/69.159.141.0/ipbits/0/expire/1491620980/sparams/ip,ipbits,expire,id,itag,source,requiressl,ratebypass,live,cmbypass,goi,sgoap,sgovp,hls_chunk_host,ei,gcr,playlist_type,mm,mn,ms,mv,pl/signature/47B407539558666D3453970D3B902E5D9A839114.1C1F737E617667A8E79416CF250376199F37DC69/key/dg_yt0/playlist/index.m3u8
```

### Untested or not working
These are the alternatives I've considered to test. Some of them are untested. Some others I've faced problems.

####ofxGStreamer
It seems that some videos libs [ofGStreamer](https://github.com/arturoc/ofxGStreamer) might be able to handle this. See:

https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/5308

Decided to give it a try! But... Zut! Problems to run the example so far! Stuck in this error here:

https://forum.openframeworks.cc/t/ofaxisgrab-gst-gst-h-error-with-maverick-of-v8/14273/5

#### ofxVideoPipe
Another alternative would be to create a pipe via ffmpeg directly to openframeworks. Maybe this lib could help on this:
https://github.com/heisters/ofxVideoPipe

#### [PROBLEM] Baldtrump
Ben Snell used the black magic device for the capture. His result was awesome!

https://github.com/bensnell/samson

His code used Kyle McDonaldâ€™s add-on ofxBlackmagic:

https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxBlackmagic

Problem: Need to buy this device that costs around 181 dollars.  :(

#### [PROBLEM] ofxStreamer
This was the first option I tried:

https://github.com/HalfdanJ/ofxStreamer

The library seems a bit outdated. It took me a while to be able to run the examples (about this, if you ever try this path again, remember to include CoreFoundation.framework, CoreVideo.framework, and VideoDecodeAcceleration.framework inside your project, so that compilation works).

Now I'm facing problems in properly encoding the video using ofxStreamerSender.

The problem seems to be in function:
```
bool ofxStreamerSender::sendFrame(unsigned char *data, int data_length);
```

I particular, in the line...
```
//Convert to YUV format
sws_scale(imgctx, (const uint8_t* const*) &data, &stride, 0, height, frame->data, frame->linesize);
```
If the line above is uncommented, the system compiles all right, but it crashes after a few seconds.

If I comment this line, the system does not crashes, but: (a) I get the warning: "[warning] No encoded frame to send, make sure to call encodeFrame"; and (b) Data seems to be received by the receiver, but all I get is a green screen.

This seems to be a bug in ofxStreamer. Just found details in this link:

https://github.com/HalfdanJ/ofxStreamer/issues/2?_pjax=%23js-repo-pjax-container

#### [PROBLEM] ofxIPVideoGrabber

Link: https://github.com/bakercp/ofxIPVideoGrabber

Not really what we're looking for, made for IP cameras.

#### [PROBLEM] ofxVLCVideoPlayer

Link: https://github.com/jnakanojp/ofxVLCVideoPlayer

Seems to work only with local files, and not with networked video streams. At least in theory, supporting networked streams could be possible by using [libvlc](https://wiki.videolan.org/LibVLC). However, this would require studying libvlc.... :(

#### Others
Potentially useful links:
- https://github.com/arturoc/ofxGstV4L2Sink (linux only?)
- https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxOMXPlayer (processing needs to be done in the raspberry pi?)
- https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer

## Efficient backstream
### FFmpeg screen capture
So far, this approach is working fine! Seems reliable and multiplatform!

### Baldtrump
Ben Snell used Syphon to stream from the manipulated video from oF to youtube. The result was again awesome!

Apparently, it is possible to integrate syphon with ffmpeg:
