Here, I cover research on:
1. **Efficient capturing**: How to efficiently capture a TV video and manipulate it via code;
2. **Efficient backstream**: How to efficiently stream the manipulated video back to the internet/Raspberry PI?

# Efficient capturing
## Baldtrump
Ben Snell used the black magic device for the capture. His result was awesome!

His code used Kyle McDonaldâ€™s add-on ofxBlackmagic:

## ofxVideoPipe
Another alternative would be to create a pipe via ffmpeg directly to openframeworks. Maybe this lib could help on this:

An interesting question would be: can we do the other way around, and avoid Syphon in our way back for the streamming?

# Efficient backstream
## FFmpeg screen capture
So far, this approach is working fine! Seems reliable and multiplatform!

## Baldtrump
Ben Snell used Syphon to stream from the manipulated video from oF to youtube. The result was again awesome!

Apparently, it is possible to integrate syphon with ffmpeg:
