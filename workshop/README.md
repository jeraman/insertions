# Insertions into Mediatic Circuits: a Hands-on Workshop
In this workshop, we will give a practical introduction to this framework. In particular, we are going to focus only on live videos circulating on the internet (e.g. Youtube Live, Facebook Live, Periscope.tv, etc).

As concrete outcomes for this workshop, we expected to provide:

- **Introduction:** A general overview of the project (motivation, scope, etc) - 15 min;
- **Behind the curtain:** How to do an insertion on web using the framework (on OS X only) -  1h ;
- **Action:** Collaboratively design at least one new insertion using the framework - 2h 30 min;
- **Conclusion:** Have a glimpse of future directions and open doors for future collaborations - 15 min;

Things to have in mind:
- This is a pilot! ;)
- Please, be responsible on what you do using this tool;
- The workshop is going to be video documented and this video could be exhibited as part of a potential future exhibition.

## Introduction
[Here](presentation.pdf)!

## Behind the curtains
I've prepared a small hands-on tutorial on how people could get started in doing insertions.

This tutorial is available for [Linux](https://github.com/jeraman/insertions/tree/master/linux) and [OSX](https://github.com/jeraman/insertions/tree/master/osx).

We'll quickly go over these steps on OS X so that you can understand the whole process.

If you want to follow these steps in your computer (so that you can do an insertion by yourself, instead of collaboratively), I encourage you! I think this is feasible and I'll help as I can!

## Action!
GO!!!!

## Conclusion
We are moving towards the DIY Insertion Guerrilla kit:
- We have the back streaming working via Raspberry Pi and the OBS software;
- We are capturing live HD signal by using an antenna and an USB Tv Tuner;
- Just ordered an [Ninja Remote 2](ninja-remote.png) to explore possibilities in controlling TVs.

If you would like to collaborate on this, or keep informed about how this goes, let me know! ;)
